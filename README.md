# Setup your Google Cloud Storage credentials
- Contact Kévin to get a json containing the gsutil key allowing you to read the bucket EEIA
- Store it somewhere for instance `~/gcp/auth.json` and get the path
- store it in an environment variable `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/gcp/auth.json`. Better to put the line in your `.bashrc` to persist the key for every terminal.
